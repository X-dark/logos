# Contributing to the repository

I created this collection because I wanted something to add as a submodule
in all of the projects that I worked on and, over the years, I accumulated quite
a collection. It is not intended to be a collection of all logos that exist, but
merely a few common ones that I have had need of at one time or another.

Additions may be requested by opening an issue, and you are more than welcome to
work on any such issues, creating or updating graphics where needed. I do not,
however, accept pull requests for unrequested graphics, and may close issues opened
requesting new logos that I do not wish to add.

Any SVG added **MUST** be run through `svgo --pretty`, and **SHOULD** be kept to a fairly
small size. SVGs **MUST NOT** include any raster images, either embedded or linked.
They also **MUST** include a `viewBox` attribute.
